This site is a probably futile attempt to gather together my various published and (mostly) unpublished writings on global popular music over the past couple of decades.

My thinking about this subject has been shaped by many sources, but I’ve been particularly indebted to Will Straw’s writings on music scenes; Shuhei Hosokawa’s concept of “soy sauce music”; Josh Kun’s concept of audiotopia; Joanna Demers’ and Mandy-Suzanne Wong’s theorizations of sound objects in electronic music; and my continuing ongoing conversation about global popular music with Hyunjoon Shin.

My exploration of the transnational flows of popular music around the globe began with a paper on world music at the “Producão Cultural: Centro/Periferia” conference in Maceió, Brazil, in 1992, which was subsequently published in the journal *Diaspora*.

I subsequently presented a paper titled “World Music: The Relocation of Culture,” which focused on the globalization of Indonesian gamelan music, at the “Globalization and Creativity” roundtable organized by the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation in 1996. A shorter version of the paper was subsequently published in UNESCO's 1998 *World Culture Report*. 

I then presented a paper on the Nortec Collective, a Mexican electronic music collective, titled “‘El Download es Cultura’: Electronic Music in Latin America,” at the conference “Critical Worlds I: From Slave Music to World Music,” at the Université de Montréal in 2004.

My next project was an article on the globalization of Japanese popular music, focusing on the emergence of the indie music genre known as Shibuya-kei in Japan in the late 1980s, which played a key role in the popularization of Japanese popular music in the 1990s and beyond. This was published in the Cambridge University journal *Popular Music*.

{% endmarginnote %}
My Shibuya-kei article laid the groundwork for my book on one of the most influential albums associated with the movement, *Fantasma*, released in 1997 by the musician Cornelius (Keigo Oyamada). This was published in 2019 in Bloomsbury’s 33 1/3 album series.

I also contributed an article about the genesis of the project to the 33 1/3 blog.

Over the past five years I’ve continued to present my research on global popular music at conferences in Japan, Singapore, and China, including papers on John Lennon’s song “Imagine” as a global audiotopia, on the convergence between Asian hip hop and food culture, on the popularization of post-rock in Asia, and on the the digital music videos of Cornelius and Koichiru Tsujikawa. 

I’m planning to post online versions of all of these papers over the coming year.

This overview doesn’t include my papers on the globalization of chipmusic and ludomusicology of the past decade--I'll try to make a separate page about them soon.
